# recovery_device_xiaomi_rubens  (Recovery 设备树 rubens)  
for Redmi K50  (红米K50)  
MT6895 (Dimensity 8100)  (天玑8100)  

kernel from MIUI 13.0.5 boot
  
**Notice: This project WIP**  
**注意这个项目未完成**  
because header version is 4 and boot are separated into boot and vendor_boot, also this device was released with Android 12, so I can't deal with it. Maybe I can make it when twrp-12 is released.  
出厂安卓12, 采用最新的Boot Header Version 4, 分割boot（分为boot和vendor_boot）我无能为力, 也许等twrp-12发布了我才能做，现在还是等大佬做吧。
